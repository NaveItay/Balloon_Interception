### Project steps:

1. Circuit Diagram
2. Data labeling
3. Training CNN model (Darknet framework)
4. Balloon Detection                 
5. Object Tracking Camera
6. Laser Balloon Interception

###### Data labeling
> ![alt text](/github_images/Label.PNG)
> The dataset contains about 1000 labeled images, a free dataset downloaded from [googleapis.com](https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/web/index.html),
>

###### YOLOv4-tiny Convolutional Neural Network
> ![alt text](/github_images/yolov4_architecture.PNG)
> YOLO uses a totally different approach than other previous detection systems. It applies a single neural network to the full image.
> This network divides the image into regions and predicts bounding boxes and probabilities for each region.
> These bounding boxes are weighted by the predicted probabilities.
> The basic idea of YOLO is exhibited in the figure below. YOLO divides the input image into an S Ã— S grid and each grid cell is responsible for predicting the object centered
> in that grid cell.
